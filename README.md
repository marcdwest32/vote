This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Take Home Projects - Build a Voting App
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
